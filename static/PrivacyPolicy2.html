      <h2>Our Privacy Commitment to you</h2>
      <p>Visit Mauritius is an online data collection group focused on providing high-quality data to our clients who are mainly in the market and marketing research industries, as well as being in other business sectors. You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is of the utmost importance to us. All of the data we collect via our research studies are provided to our clients in aggregate form i.e. information is provided about groups of individuals and not on an individual level. Personal information about you would only be provided to our clients in specific research studies and we would never provide your personal information to our clients unless we have first received your consent. All personal information you do provide to us is held securely, in confidence and in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>The information we collect</h2>
      <p>Your participation in any of our panels and surveys is voluntary. To become a panel member, you must fill out a registration form that gathers some personal and general consumer information about you. By doing so, you acknowledge and agree that you provide personal information to our Mauritius based company; Analysis Co Ltd, and that such information will be stored on servers owned by us and located in Mauritius. We ask for your email address so that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, household size, income, education and employment status is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects. All email contact from Visit Mauritius will be sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon registration. After registration, you may complete your profile and provide us with more personal information so that we may invite you to appropriate surveys.  </p>

      <p>In some circumstances, Visit Mauritius may ask you to inform us of your sensitive personal information and if required by law, we will ask you for your consent to the processing of such sensitive personal information. Examples of sensitive personal information are; your racial or ethnic origin; your political opinions; you physical or mental health or condition; and your sexual life.  This information will only be shared with third parties if necessary for specific research studies and only if you have provided your prior consent to the participation in such studies.  We may provide sensitive personal information about you if required by a court order to do so.</p>


      <p>You should be aware that any personal information you choose to make public on the Application can be read, collected, or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit or make public. In addition, we are not responsible for the content you publicly post on the site that can be found via web-based search engines. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at info@Visit Mauritius. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, (unless required by law) in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>

      <h2>Use of this information</h2>
      <p>The information you provide to us is processed for the purpose of building and operating a worldwide proprietary database of panelists, in order to conduct marketing and market research studies.  If you are a member of the Visit Mauritius panel, your information is stored in our proprietary database so we may call upon it to determine which people match up with specific research studies. If we think your profile makes you a potential candidate for a study, we will email you an invitation to make you aware of this opportunity. </p>

      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell or transfer the personal information collected about our panel members or the individuals that take surveys for us.

We may also in certain specific market research programs (and with your express prior consent) disclose your personal information to third parties for the purposes of providing such specific market research services to our clients.</p>

      <p>From time to time, Visit Mauritius may use third-party software for email list management and email distribution, or may use third party list management providers to match our panel members to members of other lists or panels, or to validate the accuracy of personal information you provide.
